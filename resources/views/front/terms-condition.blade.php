                                    Currently, we plan to retain user data while an account is active and for at least
                                    three years afterwards. We may alter this practice according to legal and business
                                    requirements. For example, we may lengthen the retention period for some data if
                                    needed to comply with law or voluntary codes of conduct. Unless otherwise
                                    prohibited, we may shorten the retention period for some types of data if needed to
                                    free up storage space. Management of User Information: You can access and manage

                                        management team to help you out but the person filling the admission form is
                                        completely responsible for filling the form within 72 hours of registration.

                                        case the registration amount is neither refundable nor adjustable in any other

                                        This means that the content being taught and studied during the batch’s start
                                        will be what matters, rather than what was outlined during the registration
                                        process. This ensures that students are taught according to the most current and
                                        up-to-date syllabus when they actually begin their studies.</li>

                                </p>
                                <ul class="normalList">
                                    <li>Students are not allowed to share their personal numbers with any other students
                                        either of their batchmates or with any of the students of the Institute.</li>
                                    <li> Institute provides group chat and subject or doubt discussion facilities over
                                        its own application which is available for both android and iOS.</li>
                                    <li>Students are not allowed to share their personal data like phone number, e-mail
                                        and any other contact information through which he/she can be contacted over the
                                        application chat/course discussion section or over the public forum or in the
                                        live class (through vocal or online platform’s chat box). If any of the students
                                        found doing so, he/she will be dismissed or blocked from the class and also from
                                        the application or all other facilities and opportunities will be denied or
                                        both. The reason behind doing so is that we respect the privacy of every student
                                        and due to some past bad experiences faced by the Institute/management, the
                                        management/Institute has taken the decision to do so.</li>
                                    <li> None of the students is allowed to ask for other students’ personal information
                                        (phone number, e-mail and any other contact information through which he/she can
                                        be contacted), if any of the students found doing so, he/she will be dismissed
                                        or blocked from the class and also from the application or all other facilities
                                        and opportunities will be denied or both.</li>
                                    <li>Students are not allowed to use abusive words or any other words which may make
                                        other students feel bad, and in this case if the student is found guilty by the
                                        Institute/Management then he/she will be dismissed or blocked from the class and
                                        also from the application or all other facilities and opportunities will be
                                        denied or both. And, Institute/management will have the final say in this case.

                                        block them then, student has to send an apology email to the institute and
                                        institute/management will have the final call whether they want to unblock the
                                        student or not, student and only the student will be responsible for his/her
                                        missed classes. In case the student gets unblocked by the management/Institute
                                        and the student repeats the same mistake for the second time then he/she has to
                                        pay Rs10,000 + GST as a fine with an apology letter for doing so, and then only

                                        the recorded session, but in case due to some technical issue the recording of
                                        the class is not provided on the application then student cannot demand for the

                                        will be banned from taking the class.</li>

                                    <li> Internal assessment is not equivalent to written and viva examination, it just
                                        shows the completion of the course. </li>
                                </ul>
